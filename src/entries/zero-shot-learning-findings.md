# Summary 

Implications and findings offew shot learning.


Conclusions:

- **Effectiveness** - The effectiveness of “Few shot learning” is more effective on GPT-4 models 
  - **GPT-3** = less effective; with slight answer variation
  - **GPT-4** = more effective; with more pronounced answer variation

- **Bias** - Few shot learning can introduce bias (positive & negative)

- **Answer (Accuracy)** - As with bias, this also changes the answer (and even the accuracy) 

Implications:

- The data provided in “Few shot learning” is critical for accuracy and “good answers”

- “Few shot learning” is more effective on GPT-4 models

- Becareful of introducing bias (ie making models produce answers that lean (or change) answers based on the learning examples provided)
